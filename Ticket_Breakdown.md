# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here
### 1. Implement DataBase model for Custom Agent Ids
- Acceptance criteria: I am able to assign a Custom Agent ID to an Agent assigned to my Facility. This Custom Agent ID is only available to my Facility. No other Facility can Create/Edit/Delete a Custom Agent ID of other Facilities. Facility ID can be taken from Auth credentials. I am able to edit an already assigned Custom Agent ID. I am able to delete an already existing Custom Agent ID. Duplicate Custom Agent IDs are not allowed. API work only.
- Time estimate: 3 days
- Implementation details: A new table is needed which will contain the Custom Agent IDs correspondant to each Facility. Implement basic CRUD operations for this task. Implement restrictions by checking the Facility owner on each request. Update Postman for the QA team.


### 2. Add create custom Id option to the Facilities admin panel
- Acceptance criteria: As a Facility administrator I am able to go to the Settings panel and click on Custom IDs tab. I should be able to see a list of all the Agents. I should be able to create Custom IDs, modify existing Custom IDs and remove existing Custom IDs. All this actions should be doable on the same tab. A warning modal should be shown before save and delete actions take place.
- Time estimate: 3 days
- Implementation details: A new tab should be added to the Settings section of the admin panel. A Datatable showing all existing Agents should show, with an extra column for the Custom ID field. This field should default to empty if no Custom ID is assigned. Custom ID field should be editable on click with an auto save feature. A last column should also be added to each row to provide the option to remove the existing Custom ID for each Agent.

### 3. Implement report generation option using custom id
- Acceptance criteria: I am able to generate and receive reports that show Custom Agent IDs instead of our internal IDs. PDFs should be readable upon download and should stick to our design guidelines. See mockups 2.0.3 at https://example.com/
- Time estimate: 2 days
- Implementation details: As shown in the docs of PDF-PARSER, we should add a new field to the parsing options that enables the replacement of the ID rows to show our new Custom Agent IDs, if they exist on the database. If there is no Custom Agent ID assigned to that specific Agent in that specific Facility, show the regular ID instead.

### 4. Add Unit & End to End tests
- Acceptance criteria: At least 80% code coverage for the Unit Tests. Test all Create/Edit/Delete options using End to End tests
- Time estimate: 1 day
- Implementation details: Use our End to End pixel by pixel image comparation service to test out the PDF generated by the platform. Use Selenium to test the Custom ID flow. Use Jest to test the UI.
